The objective is to predict, based on diagnostic measurements, whether a patient is diabetic.
The dataset is composed only of women (> 21 years old).

Clone and Explore the Dataset: Clone the repository and explore the diabetes prediction dataset containing information on pregnancy glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, BMI, and age.

Data Cleaning: Preprocess the dataset by addressing missing values, handling outliers, and ensuring data quality for accurate model training.

Feature Selection: Identify and select relevant features from the dataset to enhance the model's predictive accuracy.

Split Dataset (Train, Test): Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to assess the model's generalization performance.

Build and Train the Model: Implement logistic regression using PySpark to build and train the diabetes prediction model.

Evaluate Model Performance & Test the Model: Assess the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score on the test dataset.

Save the Model: Save the trained logistic regression model for future use and deployment in real-world applications.
